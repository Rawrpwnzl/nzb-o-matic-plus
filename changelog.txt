2006 Sep 11 - v0.51 penndu/over
	+ Modify the directories : the cache directory and the config files are now in %APPDATA%\nomp
	  (until this exist) and the default download directory is in "my documents". It's because we
	  have not always the right to write in the pathtoexe directory (install made bye an administrator)
	* [Bug #5564] fixed the bug with article shown queued and never downloaded 
	  (modify FillQueues to add the articles beeing donloading)

	  (rebuilding dl queue when pause, unpause or moving an aticle in the queue)
	* Fixed a bug who let a file open when no space left on disk while writing 
	  (verify the space left on disk before opening file)(WMI should be replaced with DriveInfo when
	  migration to .NET 2.0)
	* Fixed a bug while decoding missformed yenc header (rewrite correctly the spaces in the line)
	+ Modify the totalMB : only the articles to be downloaded (ie not the paused ) are treated in the 
	  count, so the remaining time is the real time until the download is ready
	+ Modify the completedMB : only the segments to be downloaded are counted (ie not the paused), so 
	  the completed cant be greather than the total
	+ Modify completion (same reasons as above)
	* Fixed connect retry : when connect is OK, the ConnectAttempts must be reseted
	+ Migrate to .NET 2.0

2005 Mar 14 - v0.47
	* Fixed the '%z' so that it supports 'msgidlist_uid' files from newzbin as well

	* Fixed the monitor folder option to wait until the file has finished downloading.
	
2005 Feb 10 - v0.45

	Whenever a new nzb file is created in this folder it will automatically be
	imported into NOMP.

2005 Feb 09 - v0.44
	* Fixed bug with importing a nzb file and then having the config files saved in the wrong folder
	* Fixed bug with opening the window from the tray and having it set the window size to 0x0
	* Fixed 'disconnect on idle' so that it saves it to the options file
	+ Changed the import NZB functionality to allow importing multiple .nzb
		files at one time
	+ Added a new download folder option '%z' which can be used for nzb files imported
		from newzbin (msgid_111111_Blah.nzb will become Blah).  If the nzb file
		doesn't follow the msgid_<number> format it will just create the folder
		the same way the '%i' does
	+ Saves the window location now and whether or not the form is maximized
	+ Added option to empty the cache
